Installation dependency:

	     PSFILE: http://www.seehuhn.de/pages/psfile

Unfortunately PSFILE is not available via setuptools and the cheese factory.

XXPaper generates postscript files representing charters, privates,
shares, and trains as defined by a configuration passed on the
command line.  All art is made using a format which is friendly to
die-cutting.  Cutlines are provided in the "outline" files for hand
cutting.  Alignment lines are provided for all files that allow
accurate die placement when using a die cutter.

A sample configuration file can be found in the "samples" directory
of the source tree.  The sample file produces privates, shares and
train art sized suitably for the test die that comes with an Ellison
Pro die cutter.
