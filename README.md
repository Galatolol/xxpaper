xxpaper
=======

Installation dependency:

	     PSFILE: http://www.seehuhn.de/pages/psfile

Unfortunately PSFILE is not available via setuptools and the cheese factory.

XXPaper generates postscript files representing charters, privates,
shares, and trains defined by a configuration passed on the command
line.  All art is made using a format whih is friendly to die-cutting.

A sample configuration file can be found in the "samples" directory
of the source tree.  The sample file produces privates, shares and
train art sized suitably for the test die that comes with an Ellison
Pro die cutter.
