First release
=============

- Set the default adjustments for token pages to fit the GarageSalePup label sheets (or whtever I end up with).
- See if *_embed can be/needs extension to allow in-typ named aggregations/clip-art.  Of create a *_thing(?) to the same end.
- Look into support for radial fades for *_box.  Intended use is to blur the edges of *_interior_box so as to hide registration wobbles.
- Probably then have to support linear fades just for completeness.
- And fades in *_shapes?
- Corner & end properties for *_line and *_shape?
- Create XXP_font_* files for all of the Postscript 14.
- Remove AppleGaramond -- the license isn't clean enough.
- Validate .xxpaperrc use.

Candidates
==========

- 1825-like share template option?
- Do I really need a *_scale?  Assume that will necessitate a *_pop.
- Hex clip-art for 1829
- Anchor clip-art for 1843
- Shield clip-art for weanies.
- Basic heraldic patterning for shield interiors?
- Also Amtrak-style fat shield?
- Recursive clip-art support?  (It should just work)
- Support shares being _embed and _scale for B&O-like privates?
- Support background _scale clips (eg for privates -- relevant image behind the text?)  (Will require alpa support?)
