XXPaper
=======

Installation:

	     pip install xxpaper

Should do the job.  Well, it will get you the older v0.x version of
XXPaper, which is rather different and less well featured.  XXPaper
v1.x is still upcoming.

XXPaper generates artfiles representing charters, privates,
shares, station markers, trains and (linear) stock markets (2D stock
markets coming later) as defined by a configuration passed on the
command line.  All art is made using a format which is friendly to
die-cutting.

This is now version 1.x of XXPaper.  It is not backward compatible
with v0.x versions of XXPaper.  Many things are different.  Some of
them are better.  Maybe a few things are worse.  Sample configuration
files can be found in the "samples" directory of the source tree.
