Sample XXPaper files to demonstrate the tool and techniques:

colours.xxp
===========

A demonstration file using jinja to create a grid of the 28 default
colours and their names.


1830-Historical-Papers.xxp
==========================

A simple and very straight-forward implementation for 1830 using the
historical colours for the companies.


1830-Traditional-Papers.xxp
===========================

A simple and very straight-forward implementation for 1830 using the
traditional colours for the companies from the Avalon Hill game.


1839-Papers.xxp
===============

A more complex example that uses Jinja heavily so that most things,
names and colours and such, can be defined in one place and then
automatically picked up for charters, shares, tokens etc.  Also
includes such details as two sizes of charters, jinja-calculated
revenue charts in two orientations, a phase track (drawn as a type of
market), player turn order cards (drawn as a type of train), etc.


1898-Papers.xxp
===============

A complex jinja-based implementation with multiple share/issue sizes,
side splits on share stripes, etc.
